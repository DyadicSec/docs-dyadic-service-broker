## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Dyadic Enterprise Key Management (EKM) provides a scalable, key management platform for both virtualized and non-virtualized environments. 
Dyadic EKM is a software solution that delivers security guarantees comparable to ones that require deployment and 
integration of the dedicated hardware elements.

Using Dyadic EKM Service Broker for PCF, developers store and manage cryptographic keys with a software solution 
that provides the same strong levels of security as a hardware solution (Hardware Security Modules).
 
Keys remain as secure as if they were locked in hardware, because with the Dyadic EKM, key material is never exposed in clear text at any point during the key lifecycle, even when itâ€™s created or in use. Maintain full control of your keys anywhere: on-prem, on the cloud, any key, and any cloud.

Dyadic EKM Service Broker for PCF includes the following key features:

* Hardware-level security without hardware
* Elastic and easily scalable
* Platform agnostic and supports cloud vendors, including but not limited to AWS, Azure, and Rackspace
* Supports all standard RSA, AES, and ECC keys while remaining transparent to the app
* Transparently supports standard crypto-APIs: KMIP, PKCS#11, Microsoft CNG, OpenSSL
* Installation does not disrupt the existing app workflow
* Lifecycle management of crypto-keys including partitioning, BYOK (Bring Your Own Key), generation, renewal, archiving, and revocation
